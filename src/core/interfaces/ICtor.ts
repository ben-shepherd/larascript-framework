/**
 * Represents a constructor type for classes that can be instantiated.
 * 
 * @description
 * ICtor is a generic type that describes the shape of a class constructor.
 * It can be used to pass references to classes that can be initialized with the 'new' keyword.
 * 
 * @typeparam T - The type of the instance that will be created by the constructor.
 *                Defaults to 'any' if not specified.
 * 
 * @example
 * class MyClass {}
 * 
 * function createInstance<T>(ctor: ICtor<T>): T {
 *   return new ctor();
 * }
 * 
 * const instance = createInstance(MyClass);
