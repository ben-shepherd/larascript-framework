/**
 * BaseAdapter is a generic abstract class that provides a foundation for implementing adapter patterns.
 * It manages a collection of typed adapters and provides methods for safely adding and retrieving them.
 * 
 * The class uses a generic type parameter AdapterTypes that extends BaseAdapterTypes, allowing for
 * type-safe adapter management where each adapter must conform to the specified interface.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Type-safe adapter storage and retrieval
 * - Prevention of duplicate adapter registration
 * - Centralized adapter management
 * - Error handling for missing or duplicate adapters
 * 
 * This class is typically extended by service classes that need to manage multiple implementations
 * of a particular interface, such as authentication adapters, storage adapters, or payment providers.
 * 
 * @example
 * class AuthService extends BaseAdapter<AuthAdapters> {
 *   // Implements specific auth service functionality while inheriting adapter management
 * }
