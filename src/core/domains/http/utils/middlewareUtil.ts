 * Utility class for handling middleware conversions and transformations.
 * 
 * This class provides static methods to convert between different middleware formats,
 * specifically handling the conversion of custom middleware classes and Express middleware
 * functions into a standardized Express middleware format.
 * 
 * The main purpose is to allow the application to work with both:
 * 1. Class-based middlewares (extending the base Middleware class)
 * 2. Standard Express middleware functions
 * 
 * This flexibility enables better organization and structure of middleware logic while
 * maintaining compatibility with Express's middleware system.
