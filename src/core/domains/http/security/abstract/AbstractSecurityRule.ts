/**
 * AbstractSecurityRule is a base class for implementing security rules in HTTP requests.
 * 
 * This abstract class provides the foundation for creating security rules that can be applied
 * to routes and endpoints. Security rules are used to enforce access control, validate requests,
 * and implement other security-related checks.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Configurable conditions for when rules should be applied (when/never)
 * - Generic type support for rule-specific options
 * - Extensible execute() method for implementing rule logic
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```ts
 * class AdminOnlyRule extends AbstractSecurityRule {
 *   protected readonly id = 'admin-only';
 *   
 *   public async execute(context: HttpContext): Promise<boolean> {
 *     return context.user?.role === 'admin';
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Security rules can be attached to routes and will be evaluated before
 * the route handler executes. If any rule returns false or throws an exception,
 * the request will be rejected.
