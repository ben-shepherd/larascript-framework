## What to work on next?


### Queable Workers
- Generic
- Should process events 
  - Implementaton: TODO
- Should process ordinary classes (must be serializeable, storable in json)

## Errors

### Future ideas
- Commands to make files e.g. a command to make a repository or a model
- Documentation
- Test suite
- Retry db connection attempts



### Commmands TODO
- We have a way to register commands, we need a command reader that parses the input, executes the appropriate command
- We want to introduce a new domain called 'make' responsible for making new files
- A help command to list all possible commands
